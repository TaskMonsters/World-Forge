# Quick Start Guide - Module Management

## Getting Started

Welcome to WorldForge v3.20.0! Your dashboard now supports full customization. Here's how to use the new module management features.

## Delete a Module

To remove a module from your dashboard, look for the red "×" button in the top-right corner of any module card. Click it to instantly remove that module from your view. The module isn't deleted from your world—it's just hidden from the dashboard. You can add it back anytime.

**Example:** If you're not using the Timeline module for your current project, click the "×" on the Timeline card to remove it and free up space for other modules.

## Add a Module

To add a module to your dashboard, scroll to the bottom and click the "➕ Add Module" button. A dialog will appear showing all available modules that aren't currently on your dashboard. Click any module card to add it instantly. The dialog closes automatically after adding.

**Example:** If you want to start tracking religions in your world, click "➕ Add Module" and then click the Religion card. The Religion module will appear on your dashboard immediately.

## Rearrange Modules

To change the order of modules on your dashboard, simply click and drag any module card to a new position. You'll see visual indicators (colored borders) showing where the module will land when you release it. Drop the module in your preferred location, and the new order is automatically saved.

**Example:** If you use the Characters module more than Map Builder, drag the Characters card to the first position so it appears at the top of your dashboard.

## Available Modules

Your dashboard can display any combination of these 22 modules:

**Core Modules:** Map Builder, Locations, Characters, Factions, Timeline, Rules, Themes

**Culture & Society:** Religion, Fashion, Languages, Cuisine, Etiquette, Social Interactions, Hierarchy

**Systems:** Magic, Economy, Politics, Technology

**Environment:** Flora & Fauna, Animals & Creatures

**Items:** Artifacts

**Utility:** Quick Reference (shows all data in one searchable table)

## Tips for Customization

**Focus on what matters:** Only display the modules you're actively using. A cleaner dashboard helps you stay focused on your current work.

**Organize by workflow:** Arrange modules in the order you typically use them. Put your most-used modules at the top for quick access.

**Project-specific layouts:** Different projects need different modules. A fantasy world might need Magic and Religion, while a sci-fi world might need Technology and Politics.

**Use Quick Reference:** If you need to see everything at once, add the Quick Reference module. It provides a searchable table of all your world data across all modules.

## Your Changes Are Saved

All customization changes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. Your module selection and order will persist when you close and reopen the application. Each world can have its own unique dashboard layout.

## Need Help?

If you accidentally remove a module you need, just click "➕ Add Module" to add it back. If you want to reset to the default layout, you can remove all modules and add back the original seven: Map Builder, Locations, Characters, Factions, Timeline, Rules, and Themes.
